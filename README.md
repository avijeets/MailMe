##MailMe
======

MailMe is a simple iOS application that allows the user to email themselves quickly and simply. Whatever is written in the app is directed to an email to yourself immediately.

Installation
======

Clone the repository:

    git clone https://github.com/avijeets/MailMe

Once cloned, open the .xcodeproj file and go into the ViewController.m file.
In it, you will see:

    NSString *emailAddress = @"a@avijeets.com";

Change the adress to your own. Once done, run the app on your phone, and it should work properly. It should email whatever you type into the canvas.
